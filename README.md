A simple personal site, based on Nodejs.

This template is very nice, so I plan to build a personal site base on it. 

## nodejs

```bash
browerify mian.js > compiled.js
```

In this project, main.js file was written based on nodejs, and it need to insert below codes when switch this file into compiled.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="compiled.js"></script>
```

## TODO

- combine with jekyll (**in progress**);
- day/night (background switch);
- support markdown file;
- support word file (write blog or article in office);
- make this site modularization;
- blog-template: using the default template of cnblog;

## CMD

- bundle exec jekyll serve
